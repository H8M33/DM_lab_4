The in-component, consisting of pages that could
reach the SCC by following links, but were not
reachable from the SCC
The out-component, consisting of pages reachable
from the SCC but unable to reach the SCC
Tendrils. Some tendrils consist of pages reachable
from the in-component but not able to reach the incomponent. The other tendrils can reach the outcomponent, but are not reachable from the outcomponent

Tubes, which are pages reachable from the incomponent and able to reach the out-component,
but unable to reach the SCC or be reached from
the SCC
Isolated components that are unreachable from
the large components and unable to reach those

Web pages would have a large number of surfers
were considered more “important” then pages that
would rarely be visited
The content of a page was judged not only by the
terms, but by in/out the links to that page

Motivations
Yakupov Azat 18
Users of the Web “vote with their feet”. They share
links to pages they think are good or useful
The behaviour of a random surfer indicates which
pages users are likely to visit

Definition of PageRank

Russian mathematician Andrey Markov
“
”
Markov process is a process for which
one can make predictions for its future
based solely on its present state just
as well as one could knowing the
process's full history. In other words,
conditional on the present state of the
system, its future and past states are
independent.

How to use
Yakupov Azat 64
Decide on the topics for which we shall create specialized PageRank vectors.
Pick a teleport set for each of these topics, and use that set to compute the
topic-sensitive PageRank vector for that topic.
Find a way of determining the topic or set of topics that are most relevant for a
particular search query.
Use the PageRank vectors for that topic or topics in the ordering of the
responses to the search query.

How to use
Yakupov Azat 65
Find a way of determining the topic or set of topics that are most relevant for a
particular search query.
Allow the user to select a topic from a menu.

Architecture of a Spam Farm
Yakupov Azat 70
Spam farm - of pages whose purpose is to increase the PageRank
of a certain page or pages
Inaccessible pages: the pages that the spammer cannot affect.
Most of the Web is in this part.
From the point of view of the Spammer the Web is divided into 3 areas
Accessible pages: those pages that, while they are not controlled
by the spammer, can be affected by the spammer.
Own pages: the pages that the spammer owns and controls.

lower the score of spam pages

be spam and allows the search engine to eliminate those pages or
to lower their PageRank strongly

HITS Algorithm
Yakupov Azat 85
HITS - hyperlink- induced topic search (Hubs and Authorities )
Certain pages are valuable because they provide information about
a topic. These pages are called authorities.
Other pages are valuable not because they provide information
about any topic, but because they tell you where to go to find out
about that topic. These pages are called hubs.
